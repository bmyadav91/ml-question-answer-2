    "# 75. Can Naive Bayes be used for regression tasks?\n",
    "# Ans: No, Naive Bayes is primarily designed for classification tasks. It predicts discrete class labels, not continuous values. While there have been attempts to adapt Naive Bayes for regression, they are generally not as effective as dedicated regression algorithms like linear regression, support vector regression, or decision trees. These algorithms are specifically designed to predict continuous values and often provide better performance for regression tasks."

In other words, knowing the value of one feature does not provide any information about the value of another feature, once the class is known.\n",
